My name is Gabe, and I'm a designer and web developer based out of New York City. This website was built using using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.reactjs.org">React</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com">Gatsby</a>.
<!--I graduated from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://gallatin.nyu.edu">NYU Gallatin</a> with a concentration in American Media Studies and a minor in Graphic Design.-->
<div style={{padding: '1rem', margin: '5rem 0rem 5rem 0rem', border: '1px dashed tomato', borderColor: 'tomato'}}>
  This color is called `tomato`.
</div>
<div style={{padding: '1rem', margin: '5rem 0 5rem 0', border: '1px dashed tomato', borderColor: 'tomato'}}>
  This is just me messing around. Seems like I can simply put my css in here
</div>
