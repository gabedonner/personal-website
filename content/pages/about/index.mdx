I was born and raised in Baltimore, MD. New York is where I live currently, but Baltimore will always be home.

When I'm not designing or developing, I enjoy reading (especially philosophy), writing, drawing, and watching movies.

My American Media studies concentration sythesized classes in American Studies, Media Studies, Philosophy, and Design. During undergrad, I was particularly interested in semiotics (the study of meaning-making) and propaganda studies. I also took classes in Computer Science and Web Development.

export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '0.2rem',
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

<Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> and <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> are my favorite colors.

I can write **Markdown** alongside my _JSX_!
