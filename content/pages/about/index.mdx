Hi, I'm Gabe.

Since 2015, I've worked as a freelance designer and web developer for businesses and non-profits in New York, Baltimore, and San Francisco.
Some of my past clients include: [nfuse](https://nfusemagnesium.com), [Maysles Documentary Center](https://www.maysles.org), and [The Access Project](https://accessprojectca.org).

I graduated from [NYU Gallatin](https://gallatin.nyu.edu) in 2020 with an individualized major that combined topics from Media Studies, Philosophy, and American Studies.
I also received a minor in Graphic Design and took classes in Computer Science, Web Development, and Interactive Narrative.
