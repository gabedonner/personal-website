Hi, I'm Gabe.

Since 2015, I've worked as a freelance designer and web developer for businesses and non-profits in New York, Baltimore, and San Francisco.
Some of my past clients include <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nfusemagnesium.com">nfuse</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.maysles.org">Maysles Documentary Center</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://accessprojectca.org">The Access Project</a>

I graduated from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://gallatin.nyu.edu">NYU Gallatin</a> in 2020 with an individualized major that combined topics from Media Studies, Philosophy, and American Studies.
I also received a minor in Graphic Design and took classes in Computer Science, Web Development, and Interactive Narrative.
