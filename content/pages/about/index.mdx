<!--I was born and raised in Baltimore, MD. New York is where I live currently, but Baltimore will always be home.

When I'm not designing or developing, I enjoy reading (especially philosophy), writing, drawing, and watching movies.

My American Media studies concentration sythesized classes in American Studies, Media Studies, Philosophy, and Design. During undergrad, I was particularly interested in semiotics (the study of meaning-making) and propaganda studies. I also took classes in Computer Science, Web Development.-->
